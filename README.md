# tanktargetscoringsystem
This is the first prototype of a scoring and tracking system that detects a projectile's flight path and velocity using HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors, and transmits the calculated data via an ESP8266 to an online interface. The system estimates the projectile’s path, speed, and impact point using geometric methods.
